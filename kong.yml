# Metadata fields start with an underscore (_)
# Fields that do not start with an underscore represent Kong entities and attributes

# _format_version is mandatory,
# it specifies the minimum version of Kong that supports the format

_format_version: "1.1"

# Each Kong entity (core entity or custom entity introduced by a plugin)
# can be listed in the top-level as an array of objects:

services:
- name: user-api
  url: http://localhost:8002
  # Entities that have a foreign-key relationship can be nested:
  routes:
  - name: user-api-route
    paths:
    - /user-api

  - name: proxy-cache

      content_type:
      - application/json

      strategy: memory
  - name: key-auth
- name: client-api

# When an entity has multiple foreign-key relationships
# (e.g. a plugin matching on both consumer and service)
# it must be specified as a top-level entity, and not through
# nesting.
